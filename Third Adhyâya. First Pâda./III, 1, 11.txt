11. But (karana means) nothing but good and evil works; thus B dari opines.
The teacher B dari, however, thinks that the word 'karana' denotes nothing else but good works and evil works. It means the same as anushth na (performance) or karman (work). For we see that the root kar (to walk, to conduct oneself) is used in the general sense of acting. Of a man who performs holy works such as sacrifices, &c., people say in ordinary language, 'that excellent man walks in righteousness.' The word  k ra also denotes only a kind of religious duty. That works and karana (conduct) are sometimes spoken of as different things is analogous to the distinction sometimes made between Br hmanas and Parivr gakas 2. We, therefore, decide that by men of good karana are meant those whose works are worthy of praise, by men of evil karana those whose works are worthy of blame.
