3. And on account of the going of the pr nas.
Scripture states that, when a new body is obtained, the pr nas also go (from the old body to the new one). Cp. 'When he thus departs the (chief) pr na departs after him, and when the pr na thus departs all the other pr nas depart after it' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 2), and similar passages. Now this going of the pr nas is not possible without a base; hence we infer that water also--mixed with parts of the other elements--goes (from the old body to the new one), serving the purpose of supplying a base for the moving pr nas. For the pr nas cannot, without such a base, either move or abide anywhere; as we observe in living beings.
