7. Sitting; on account of possibility.
It has been shown that that special form of cognitional activity which the Ved nta-texts set forth as the means of accomplishing final Release and which is called meditation (dhy na; up sana) has to be frequently repeated, and is of the nature of continued representation. A question now arises as to the way in which it has to be carried on.--There being no special restrictive rule, the P rvapakshin holds that the Devotee may carry it on either sitting or lying down or standing or walking.--This view the S tra sets aside. Meditation is to be carried on by the Devotee in a sitting posture, since in that posture only the needful concentration of mind can be reached. Standing and walking demand effort, and lying down is conducive to sleep. The proper posture is sitting on some support, so that no effort may be required for holding the body up.
