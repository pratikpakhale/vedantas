That breath goes to the individual soul, the following text declares, 'At the time of death all the pr nas go to the Self of a man about to expire ' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 38), Similarly Scripture mentions the departure of pr na together with the soul, 'after him thus departing the prawa departs'; and again its staying together with the soul, 'What is that by whose departure I shall depart, and by whose staying I shall stay?' (Pr. Up. VI, 3). We therefore conclude that the text 'breath with fire' means that breath joined with the individual soul becomes united with fire.
