44. On account of the majority of indicatory marks (the fire-altars built of mind, &c. do not form elements of any act); for this (i.e. the indicatory
p. 260
mark) is stronger (than the general subject-matter); this also (has been explained in the P . M . S tras).
In the Agnirahasya of the V gasaneyins, in the Br hmana beginning 'for in the beginning indeed this was not existent,' we read with reference to mind (manas),' It saw thirty-six thousand shining fire-altars, belonging to itself, made of mind, built of mind.' And, further on, the text makes similar statements about other fanciful fire-altars built of speech, built of breath, built of sight, built of hearing, built of work, built of fire.--A doubt here arises whether these fire-altars built of mind and so on are connected with the act (i.e. the construction of the fire-altar made of bricks), arid supplementary to it, or whether they are independent, constituting a mere vidy .
Against the prima facie view that those agnis are connected with the sacrificial act under whose heading the text records them, the S tra maintains their independence, 'on account of the majority of indicatory marks.' For we meet in that Br hmana with a number of indicatory marks confirming that those agnis constitute a mere vidy ; cp, e.g. the following passages: 'Whatever these beings conceive in their minds, that is a means for those fire-altars,' and 'All beings always pile up those fire-altars for him who thus knows, even when he sleeps,' and so on 1.--And that indicatory marks (li ga) are of greater force than the leading subject-matter (prakarana) has been explained in the P rva M m ms  (III, 3, 14).
