8. If it be said (that the vidy s are one) on account of (the identity of) name; (we reply that) that is explained (already); moreover that (identity of name) is (found in the case of admittedly separate vidy s).
Here it might be said that after all the unity of the two vidy s discussed must be admitted, since they are called by one and the same name, viz. 'the science of the udg tha.'--But this argument is of no avail against what has been said under the preceding S tra. The decision there advocated has the advantage of following the letter of the revealed text; the name 'udg tha-vidy ' on the other hand is not a part of the revealed text, but given to the vidy s for convenience sake by ordinary men for the reason that the word 'udg tha' is met with in the text.--Moreover, we observe that admittedly separate meditations such as the two mentioned under the last S tra have one and the same name. Similarly altogether separate sacrificial performances, such as the agnihotra, the darsap rnam sa, and so on, are all comprised under the one name K thaka, merely because they are recorded in the one book called K thaka.--Where, on the other hand, there is no special reason for assuming the difference of vidy s, their unity may be declared on the ground of identity of name; as, e.g. in the case of the Samvargavidy s.
