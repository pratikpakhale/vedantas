64. And because the text states a quality (of the vidy ) to be common (to the three Vedas).
The text states that the syllable Om which is a quality,
p. 283
i.e. the abode of a meditation, is common to the three Vedas, 'By that syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. With Om the Adhvaryu gives orders, with Om the Hotri recites, with Om the Udg tri sings.' This suggests that, as the abode of the vidy  (viz. the Omk ra) is common, the vidy s which abide in it are common also.--Or else the S tra may be explained as follows. If the udg tha and so on, which are matters qualifying the sacrificial action, were not all of them common to all sacrificial performances, the vidy s resting on them would not go together. But the scriptural passages which teach the sacrificial performances and extend over all subordinate matters, state that the udg tha and so on are common to all performances. As thus the abodes of the vidy s go together, the vidy s abiding in them go together likewise.
