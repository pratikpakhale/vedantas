47. But (the agnis rather constitute) a vidy , on account of the assertion (made by the text).
The word 'but' sets aside the p rvapaksha.--The agnis built of mind and so on are to be viewed not as complementary to a sacrificial action, but as independent and constituting a vidy  of their own. For the text expressly asserts that 'they are built of knowledge (vidy ) only,' and that 'by knowledge they are built for him who thus knows.'
