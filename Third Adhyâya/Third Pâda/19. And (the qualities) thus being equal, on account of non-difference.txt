In the book of the V gasaneyaka, called Agnirahasya, we meet with a meditation on Brahman called S ndilyavidy ; and there is also a S ndilya-vidy  in the Brihad ranyaka . The P rvapakshin holds that these two meditations are different since the latter text mentions qualities--such as Brahman being the lord of all--which are not mentioned in the former; the objects of meditation thus being different, the meditations themselves are different.
