11. But only good and evil works, thus B dari thinks.
As the verb  -kar takes karman for its object (punyam karm  karati, &c.), and as the separate denotation (i.e. the use of apparently equivalent words, viz.  kar and karman) can be accounted for on the ground that one of them refers to works established by manifest texts, and the other to texts inferred from actually existing rules of good conduct; and as, when the primary meaning is possible, no secondary meaning must be adopted; nothing else but good and evil works (in the Vedic sense) are denoted by the word karana: such is the opinion of the teacher B dari. This opinion of B dari, the author of the S tra states as representing his own. On the other hand, he adopts the view of K rshnagini in so far as he considers such items of virtuous conduct as the Sandhy --which are enjoined by scriptural texts, the existence of which is inferred on the basis of conduct as enjoined by Smriti--to have the result of qualifying the agent for the performance of other works.--The conclusion therefore is that the souls descend, carrying a remnant of their works.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the passing of works.'
