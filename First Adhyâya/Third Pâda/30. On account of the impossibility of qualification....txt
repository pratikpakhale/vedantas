30. On account of the impossibility (of qualification for the madhuvidy , &c.) (Gaimini maintains the non-qualification (of gods, &c.).
So far it has been proved that also the gods, and so on, are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman. But a further point here presents itself for consideration, viz. whether the gods are qualified or not to undertake those meditations of which they themselves are the objects. The S tra states as a p rvapaksha view held by Gaimini, that they are not so qualified, for the reason that there are no other  dityas, Vasus, and so on, who could be meditated on by the  dityas and Vasus themselves; and that moreover for the  dityas and Vasus the qualities and position of those classes of deities cannot be objects of desire, considering that they possess them already. The so-called Madhuvidy  (Kh. Up. III) represents as objects of devout meditation certain parts of the sun which are being enjoyed by the different classes of divine beings, Vasus,  dityas, and so on--the sun being there called 'madhu.' i.e. honey or nectar, on account of his being the abode of a certain nectar to be brought about by certain sacrificial works to be known from the Rig-veda, and so on; and as the reward of such meditation the text names the attainment of the position of the Vasus,  dityas, and so on.
