5. To the elements (the soul, with pr na, goes), on account of the subsequent scriptural clause.
The soul joined by the pr na takes up its abode within the subtle elements which accompany heat and form the seed of the (gross) body. This we conclude from the clause, 'Breath in heat.'--But this passage declares, not that the soul together with the pr na takes up its abode in heat, but only that the pr na takes up its abode!--No matter, we reply; since the preceding S tra intercalates the soul in the interval (between pr na and tegas). Of a man who first travels from--Srughna to Mathur  and then from Mathur  to P taliputra, we may say shortly that he travels from--Srughna to P taliputra. The passage under discussion therefore means that the soul together with the pr na abides in the elements associated with heat.--But how are you entitled to draw in the other elements also, while the text only speaks of heat?--To this question the next S tra replies.
