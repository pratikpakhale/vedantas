with Svayamprak a's commentary, translated by A. E. Gough in "The Pandit," vol. 8, 9 (Benares, 1873).
Of the chief Sanskrit texts of the Ved nta schools numerous editions have been published in India. Among the best are those issued in the "Anand rama Sanskrit Series" from the  nand rama Press, Poona.
The student is not likely to derive much exact knowledge from the publications of irresponsible neo-vedantic societies in Europe and America. These bodies have the commendable object of making the principles of the Ved nta intelligible to modern Western thinkers; but until they display a more scientific and historical spirit their success is likely to be limited.
