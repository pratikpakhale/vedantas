And the chief vital air is to be considered as minute like the other pr nas.--Here also we have to understand by minuteness that the chief vital air is subtle and of limited size, not that is of atomic size; for by means of its five functions it pervades the entire body. It must be viewed as subtle because when passing out of the body it is not perceived by a bystander, and as limited because scripture speaks of its passing out, going and coming.--But, it may be said, scripture speaks also of its all-pervadingness; so,

Moreover the statements of equality 'equal to a grub,' &c., just declare the limited size of the pr na which abides within every living being.--Thus there remains no difficulty.
