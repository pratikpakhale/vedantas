13. But the rule (over the pr nas) on the part of Fire and the rest, together with him to whom the pr na belong (i.e. the soul), is owing to the thinking of that (viz. the highest Self); on account of scriptural statement.
p. 576
It has been shown that the pr nas, together with the main pr na, originate from Brahman, and have a limited size. That the pr nas are guided by Agni and other divine beings has also been explained on a previous occasion, viz. under S . II, 1, 5. And it is known from ordinary experience that the organs are ruled by the individual soul, which uses them as means of experience and fruition. And this is also established by scriptural texts, such as 'Having taken these pr nas he (i.e. the soul) moves about in his own body, according to his pleasure'(Bri. Up. II, 1, 18). The question now arises whether the rule of the soul and of the presiding divine beings over the pr nas depends on them (i.e. the soul and the divinities) only, or on some other being.--On them only, since they depend on no one else!--Not so, the S tra declares. The rule which light, and so on, i.e. Agni and the other divinities, together with him to whom the pr nas belong i.e. the soul, exercise over the pr nas, proceeds from the thinking of that, i.e. from the will of the highest Self.--How is this known?--'From scriptural statement.' For Scripture teaches that the organs, together with their guiding divinities and the individual soul, depend in all their doings on the thought of the highest Person. 'He, who abiding within Fire, rules Fire from within.--He, who abiding within the air--within the Self--within the eye, and so on' (Bri. Up III, 7); 'From fear of it the wind blows, from fear of it the sun rises, from fear of it Agni and Indra, yea Death runs as the fifth' (Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1); 'By the command of that Imperishable one, sun and moon stand, held apart'(Bri Up III, 8, 9).
