8. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose.
Even if it were admitted that the Pradh na is established by Inference, the S nkhya theory could not be accepted for the reason that the Pradh na is without a purpose. For, according to the view expressed in the passage, 'In order that the soul may know the Pradh na and become isolated' (S nkhya K . I, 21), the purpose of the Pradh na is fruition and final release on the part of the soul; but both these are impossible. For, as the soul consists of pure intelligence, is inactive, changeless, and spotless, and hence eternally emancipated, it is capable neither of fruition which consists in consciousness of Prakriti, nor of Release which consists in separation from Prakriti. If, on the other hand, it be held that the soul constituted as described is, owing to the mere nearness of Prakriti, capable of fruition, i.e. of being conscious of pleasure and pain, which are special modifications of Prakriti, it follows that, as Prakriti is ever near, the soul will never accomplish emancipation.
