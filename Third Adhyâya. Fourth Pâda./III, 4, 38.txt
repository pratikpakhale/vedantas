38. And the promotion (of knowledge is bestowed on them) through special acts.
Also for widowers, &c., the favour of knowledge is possible through special acts of duty, such as praying, fasting, propitiation of divinities, &c., which are not opposed to their  srama-less condition and may be performed by any man as such. Thus Smriti says, 'By mere prayer no doubt the Br hmana perfects himself. May he perform other works or not, the kindhearted one is called Br hmana (Manu Samh. II, 87), which passage shows that where the works of the  sramas are not possible prayer qualifies for knowledge. Moreover knowledge may be promoted by  srama works performed in previous births. Thus Smriti also declares, 'Perfected by many births he finally goes the highest way' (Bha. G t  VI, 45); which passage shows that the aggregate of the different purificatory ceremonies performed in former births promotes knowledge.--Moreover knowledge--as having a seen result (viz. the removal of ignorance)--qualifies any one who is desirous of it for learning and so on, through the mere absence of obstacles 1. Hence there is no contradiction in admitting qualification for knowledge on the part of widowers and the like.
