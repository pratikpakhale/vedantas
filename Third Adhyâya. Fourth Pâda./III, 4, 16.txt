16. And (scripture teaches) the destruction (of the qualification for works, by knowledge).
Moreover scripture teaches that this whole apparent world-which springs from Nescience, is characterised by
p. 295
actions, agents and results of actions and is the cause of all qualification for works--is essentially destroyed by the power of knowledge. Compare such passages as 'But when all has become the Self of him, wherewith should he see another, wherewith should he smell another?' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15). For him now who should teach that the qualification for works has for its necessary antecedent the knowledge of the Self which the Ved nta-texts teach, it would follow that the qualification for works is cut short altogether. From this also it follows that knowledge is independent.
