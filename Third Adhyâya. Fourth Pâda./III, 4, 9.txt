9. But the declarations (of scripture) are equal (on the other side).
In reply to the averment made in S tra 3, we point out that there are declarations of scripture, of equal weight, in favour of the view that knowledge is not complementary to action. For there are scriptural passages such as, 'Knowing this the rishis descended from Kavasha said: For what purpose should we study the Veda? for what purpose should we sacrifice? Knowing this indeed the Ancient ones did not offer the Agnihotra;' and 'When Br hmanas know that Self and have risen above the desire for sons, wealth, and worlds, they wander about as mendicants' (Bri. Up. III, 5). Scripture moreover shows that
p. 292
[paragraph continues] Y g avalkya and others who knew Brahman did not take their stand on works. 'Thus far goes immortality. Having said so Y g avalkya went away into the forest' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15). With reference to the indicatory sign (as to the dependence of knowledge to work) which is implied in the passage, 'Sirs, I am going to perform a sacrifice,' we remark that it belongs to a section which treats of Vaisv nara. Now, the text may declare that a vidy  of Brahman as limited by adjuncts is accompanied by works; but all the same the vidy  does not stand in a subordinate relation to works since 'leading subject-matter' and the other means of proof are absent.
We now reply to the averment made in S tra 4.
