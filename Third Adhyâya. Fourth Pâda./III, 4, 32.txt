32. The works of the  sramas (are incumbent on him) also (who does not desire release); because they are enjoined.
Under S tra 26 it has been proved that the work's enjoined on the  sramas are means of knowledge. Now we will consider whether those works have to be performed also by him who does not desire final release and therefore takes his stand on his  srama merely without wishing for knowledge--Here the p rvapakshin maintains that as the works incumbent on the  sramas are enjoined as means of knowledge by the passage, 'Him the Br hmanas seek to know by the study of the Veda' &c., the works of permanent obligation are not to be performed by him who, not desirous of knowledge, wishes for some other fruit. Or else they are to be performed by him also; but then they cannot be means of knowledge, since it would be contradictory to attribute to them a permanent and a non-permanent connexion. 1
Against this conclusion the S trak ra remarks that the works of permanent obligation are to be performed by

him only who, not desirous of release, takes his stand on the  sramas merely, because they are enjoined by texts such 'as long as his life lasts he is to offer the agnihotra.' For to such texts no excessive weight must be ascribed.--The next S tra replies to the objection raised above in the words, 'but then they cannot be means of knowledge.'
