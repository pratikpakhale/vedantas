36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence being declared (in the case of the S dras).
That the S dras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also that in different places of the vidy s such ceremonies as the upanayana and the like are referred to. Compare, for instance, Sat. Br. XI, 5, 3, 13, 'He initiated him as a pupil;' Kh. Up. VII, 1, 1, 'Teach me, Sir! thus he approached him;' Pra. Up. I, 1, 'Devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman, seeking for the highest Brahman they, carrying fuel in their hands, approached the venerable Pippal da, thinking that he would teach them all that.'--Thus the following passage also, 'He without having made them undergo the upanayana (said) to them' (Kh. Up. V, 11, 7), shows that the upanayana is a well-established ceremony 1.--With reference to the S dras, on the other hand, the absence of ceremonies is frequently mentioned; so, for instance, Manu X, 4, where they are spoken of as 'once born' only ('the S dra is the fourth caste, once-born'), and Manu X, 126, 'In the S dra there is not any sin, and he is not fit for any ceremony.'
