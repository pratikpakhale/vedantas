3. Not (i.e. the abode of heaven, earth, &c. cannot be) that which is inferred, (i.e. the pradh na), on account of the terms not denoting it.
While there has been shown a special reason in favour of Brahman (being the abode), there is no such special reason in favour of anything else. Hence he (the s trak ra) says that that which is inferred, i.e. the pradh na assumed by the S nkhya-smriti, is not to be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, &c.--Why?--On account of the terms not denoting it. For the sacred text does not contain any term intimating the non-intelligent pradh na, on the ground of which we might understand the latter to be the general cause or abode; while such terms as 'he who perceives all and knows all' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9) intimate an intelligent being opposed to the pradh na in nature.--For the same reason the air also cannot be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.
