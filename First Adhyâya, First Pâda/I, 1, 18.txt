18. And on account of desire (being mentioned as belonging to the  nandamaya) no regard is to be had to what is inferred, (i.e. to the pradh na inferred by the S nkhyas.)
Since in the passage 'he desired, may I be many, may I grow forth,' which occurs in the chapter treating of the  nandamaya (Taitt. Up. II, 6), the quality of feeling desire is mentioned, that which is inferred, i.e. the non-intelligent pradh na assumed by the S nkhyas, cannot be regarded as being the Self consisting of bliss and the cause of the world. Although the opinion that the pradh na is the

cause of the world, has already been refuted in the S tra I, 1, 5, it is here, where a favourable opportunity presents itself, refuted for a second time on the basis of the scriptural passage about the cause of the world feeling desire, for the purpose of showing the uniformity of view (of all scriptural passages).
